Google's Project Oxygen was a massive, data-driven internal study launched by Google's People Analytics team in 2008. The goal was to answer a simple but crucial question: What makes a great manager?

Originally, some top executives at Google hypothesized that management might be an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, or that the best managers were simply the most technically proficient engineers. However, by analyzing thousands of performance reviews, feedback surveys, and nominations for management awards, Google proved that managers heavily impact team performance—and that soft skills matter significantly more than technical expertise.

## The 10 Behaviors of a Great Manager

Google initially identified eight core behaviors of their highest-performing managers. In 2018, as the company grew and the workplace evolved, they updated the list to include two new traits and refined the existing ones.

According to Project Oxygen, a great manager:

1. **Is a good coach:** They don't just solve problems for their team; they use challenges as teachable moments and guide employees to find the answers themselves.

2. **Empowers the team and does not micromanage:** They give their employees autonomy, trust them to execute, and provide the freedom to take calculated risks.

3. **Creates an inclusive team environment:** They foster "psychological safety," ensuring team members feel comfortable sharing ideas, admitting mistakes, and asking questions without fear of judgment.

4. **Is productive and results-oriented:** They set the tone by working hard, leading by example, and focusing on measurable outcomes rather than just busyness.

5. **Is a good communicator:** They excel at actively listening to their team and transparently sharing important information from the broader company.

6. **Supports career development and discusses performance:** They provide constructive, actionable feedback and actively invest in their team's long-term professional growth.

7. **Has a clear vision and strategy:** They ensure everyone knows the team's goals and understands how their individual work contributes to the bigger picture.

8. **Has key technical skills to help advise the team:** While not the highest priority, they possess enough technical expertise to understand the work, advise the team, and make informed decisions.

9. **Collaborates across the company:** They break down silos and work effectively with other teams and departments to benefit the whole organization. *(Added in 2018)*

10. **Is a strong decision-maker:** They analyze information, weigh their options carefully, and confidently make and stand by firm decisions. *(Added in 2018)*

## The Main Takeaway

The biggest surprise from Project Oxygen was that technical skills ranked last on the original list. Google is a company built by engineers, for engineers, yet the data proved that the most critical predictors of a manager's success were all rooted in emotional intelligence, communication, and coaching.
